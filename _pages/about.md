👋 Hi, I’m **Yi-Ru (Emma) Wu**, a Master’s student in **Computer Science at UIUC** (Fall 2025).  
I focus on **software engineering, machine learning, and computer vision**, and I enjoy building practical AI-powered applications that bridge research and real-world impact.

### 🔹 What I Do
- **Software Development**: Experienced in Python, C++, and full-stack tools for scalable systems.  
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Built projects in video editing, high-resolution image translation, autonomous driving simulation, and multimodal generation.  
- **Competitions & Recognition**: 1st place in Kaggle Danceability Prediction (80+ teams); top-ranked project presentations in CS coursework.  

### 🔹 Current Focus
I am preparing for roles in **Software Engineering (SWE)** and **ML Engineering**, where I can apply my skills in building reliable, efficient systems with strong AI/ML components.

### 🔹 Beyond Code
I enjoy organizing and mentoring, having led academic events and workshops. Outside of tech, I love traveling and exploring new cuisines 🍜✈️.
